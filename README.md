# TinKan

TinKan is our friendly helper bot for the TKTK Community Discord server, bringing several important features that folks came to rely on in the old XOXO Slack:

* `/mods` - A command to send private messages to the moderation team
* `/list-private` - A command to list the protected channels available to join
* Button-based channel access for the above command, making it easier for members to submit requests for access to protected channels, and making it easier for channel members to approve those requests
